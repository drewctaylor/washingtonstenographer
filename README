PREREQUISITES
=============

This code requires an installation of PostgreSQL and node.js.

PostgreSQL is available from its website:

http://www.postgresql.org

node.js is available from its website:

http://nodejs.org/

If you run MacOS and Homebrew, you may install both from the command line:

$ brew install postgres
$ brew install node

DATABASE
========

After you have installed PostgreSQL:

    * create the database "POLLSTER",
    * create the user "postgres" with the password "postgres",
    * create the tables and indexes for "POLLSTER", and
    * insert the data for "POLLSTER"

To do so, change to the "washingtonstenographer" directory. From the MacOS 
command line, execute the following:

$ createdb POLLSTER
$ psql POLLSTER -c "CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres'"
$ cat module/pollster/sql/pollster-schema.sql | psql POLLSTER -U postgres
$ unzip -c module/pollster/sql/pollster-data.zip | psql POLLSTER -U postgres

WEB APPLICATION
===============

After you have installed node.js:

    * install the necessary node modules.
    * synchronize the database with the Huffington Post Pollster API
    * run the web application.

To do so, change to the "washingtonstenographer" directory. From the MacOS
command line, execute the following:

$ npm install
$ node bin/synchronize
$ node web.js

After the last, open "http://localhost:8000" in your web browser. The system works
under Firefox. It may work in other browsers, too.
